Beam is a simple tool that allows members to write posts to share across your organization. Think of it like a lightweight internal blog. Features include a simple **Markdown-based** editor with preview, **image drag and drop**, comments and likes, **search**, a clean responsive layout with **dark mode support**, and an admin role for hiding posts.

## Setup

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Create a database

- [Create a PlanetScale database](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-quick-start-guide#create-a-database)
- Create a [connection string](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/connection-strings#creating-a-password) to connect to your database. Choose **Prisma** for the format
- **Alternatively**, your PlanetScale database and connection string can be generated using the [pscale CLI](https://github.com/planetscale/cli) or GitHub Actions. [View instructions](doc/pscale-actions-setup.md).
- Set up the environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- Open `.env` and set the `DATABASE_URL` variable with the connection string from PlanetScale
- Create the database schema:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### Configure authentication

GitHub and Okta authentication settings are available as defaults, but thanks to NextAuth.js, you can configure your Beam instance with most other common authentication providers.

- [Configuring GitHub authentication](doc/github_setup.md)
- [Configuring Okta authentication](doc/okta_setup.md)

Beam uses [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/), so if you prefer to use one of the [many providers](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/) it supports, you can customize your own installation. Simply update the [`lib/auth.ts`](/lib/auth.ts#L11) file to add your own provider.

### Enable image uploads (optional)

To enable image uploads, set the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_IMAGE_UPLOAD` to `true`.

Beam uses Cloudinary for storing uploaded images. You can [sign up for a free account](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free).

- On your Cloudinary dashboard, look for these values under your account settings: **Cloud Name**, **API Key**, **API Secret**.
- Update `.env` with the following variables:
  - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`: **Cloud Name**
  - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`: **API Key**
  - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: **API Secret**

### Configure Slack notifications (optional)

If you'd like to have new Beam posts published to a Slack channel, follow [these instructions](doc/slack_setup.md).

## Running the app locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
